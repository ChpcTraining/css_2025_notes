# Writing Personal Code

Welcome to Writing Personal Code, where we step away from the professional standards of coding and dive into a world of practicality, simplicity, and personal satisfaction. This talk is all about personal automation—the kind of coding you do just for yourself, not for production, not for a team, and not for anyone else's eyes.

Here’s the mindset we’re adopting:

- Personal, not professional.
- Messy, not perfect.
- Functional, not fancy.
- Calm, not stressful.

The goal? Solve your problem. That’s it. Whether it’s a tedious task you’re tired of doing manually or a quick hack to make your digital life smoother, the only thing that matters is getting from Point A (problem) to Point B (solution). The shortest path wins—even if it’s dumb, hacky, or breaks every best practice in the book.

# Why It’s Okay to Cut Corners

This isn’t code you’ll be reviewing, testing rigorously, or showing off to others. It’s personal. If it’s functional, it’s good enough. No one’s judging. You have full permission to:

Write questionable code.
Skip best practices.
Solve the problem in the simplest way possible—even if it’s not elegant.
Sometimes, the simplest (and silliest) solution works. You’d be surprised how much you can get away with when no one else is looking.

# What You'll Learn

The Essence of Personal Automation: Writing code that’s good enough to get the job done—no more, no less.
Techniques and Examples: I’ll share practical ways I’ve approached and solved real problems using personal scripts.
Tips and Tricks: From failing fast to embracing imperfection, you’ll learn how to write code that works for you, without the stress.
A Key Rule: Fail Early and Noisily
There’s just one crucial rule to follow: Fail early and noisily.
When your code runs into an issue, it should stop immediately and tell you exactly what went wrong. Let it scream at you with stack traces or error messages, so you can fix it right then and there. Don’t let silent failures or unnoticed bugs waste your time later.

# Guidelines (Not Rules)

Beyond the one rule, there are some helpful (but optional) guidelines:

Use the Latest Python Version: Take advantage of features like F-strings—they’ll make your life easier.
Automate Aggressively: Push the limits of what you can automate, even if it feels silly or unconventional.
Break the Rules: Don’t like PEP 8? Ignore it. Hate writing tests? Don’t bother. This is your playground.
Have Fun
Most importantly, have fun. This is your personal playground. If the process becomes frustrating or tedious, step back. This is about making your life easier, not harder.

Let’s dive in and explore techniques, examples, and tips for writing personal code that’s functional, fun, and unapologetically imperfect. Let’s get started!

# From Personal Code to Modular Pipelines

Now, we’re shifting gears from personal code to something much more structured and scalable: building data pipelines. While the principles of simplicity and functionality still apply, we’re stepping into a more formalized approach, especially useful for research, enterprise settings, or larger projects.

# Why Data Pipelines?

When you first start working with data, you might handle one-off projects or ad hoc scripts. But as your work evolves—whether in research or your career—you’ll find yourself:

Running recurring tasks like weekly reports.
Handling large datasets and complex codebases.
Applying consistent methodologies across multiple datasets.
To make this scalable, the key is to transition from isolated scripts to modular components that can interact and adapt to different datasets and workflows. These modular components form what we call a data pipeline—a foundational skill for productivity and an essential stepping stone for data engineering roles.

# The Power of Pipelines

Data pipelines allow you to:

Automate repetitive workflows.
Scale your work efficiently for larger datasets and projects.
Streamline tasks like exploratory data analysis (EDA) or preparing data for analytics.
Today, we’ll focus on ETL pipelines—extract, transform, and load workflows, which are ubiquitous in data science and engineering. We’ll also touch on ELT pipelines, where data is loaded early and transformations happen downstream, which can be advantageous in some cases.

# The Basics of ETL

Extract: Pull data from source systems (APIs, databases, flat files, etc.).
Transform: Clean, filter, and prepare the data for use.
Load: Store the transformed data in a database or other storage system, ready for analytics.
Our case study involves Google Play Store app data. Together, we’ll:

- Extract data from flat files.
- Transform it through filtering and cleaning.
- Load it into a database for analysis.
- Key Principles for Pipelines

Building effective pipelines isn’t just about writing code—it’s about writing good code. Here are three critical principles:

Modularity:

Unlike personal scripts, pipelines require structured, reusable logic.
Focus on writing effective functions that can be combined flexibly.

Observability:

Just as “fail early and noisily” was key in personal code, observability is critical in pipelines.
Add checks and balances to validate inputs and outputs. Ensure you can see what’s working and diagnose what’s not.

Resilience:

Pipelines must handle a variety of scenarios—not just one specific case.
Build robustness into your logic to accommodate unexpected data or failures.

# Why Learn Data Pipelines?

Data pipelines are everywhere. With the explosion of data in recent years, the ability to extract, transform, and load data efficiently is a superpower in today’s data-driven world. Whether you’re working with:

APIs, SFTP sites, relational databases, NoSQL databases, or flat files,
…pipelines make it possible to bring data from these sources into a usable format for analysis.

# The Plan

Throughout this session, we’ll:

Learn how to extract, transform, and load data programmatically using Python.
Discuss tips for making pipelines modular, observable, and resilient.
Explore tools and strategies for building production-grade pipelines.
Just as we transferred principles like “fail early and noisily” from personal scripts to pipelines (renaming it as “observability”), we’ll build on what you already know and formalize those skills. By the end, you’ll be equipped to handle larger data workflows and level up your analytics and data science capabilities.

Let’s get started!
